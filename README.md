## What is SQL?

Pronounced S. Q. L. or Sequel. Eitherway is fine!

SQL stands for Structed Query Language

Reading Data from a database is known as Querying.


- DDL Data DefnitionLanguage
- DML DataManipulationLanguage
- DCL DataControlLanguage


Common SQL Databases:

Each of these can be Queried using the SQL programming Language
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL
- SQLie 
- Oracle


Other databases 
These are often referred to noSQL databased


- GraphQL
- MongoDB

#### Where SQL used?

#### WHat is an ORM?

#### What is noSQL?




## What is a relational database?

Two major components in a database

Data(Information Stored) and Schema(How the data is organized)

Sections are called tables


##### Tables
You can think of tables as speadsheets:


| Column ↓  | Column ↓   |  Column ↓  |
|---|---|---|
| Row →   |   |   | 
| Row →   |   |   |
| Row →   |   |   | 

##### Table Organizaton

Usually seperate tables contain data for a specific type of thing:

If we look at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) again you can see all the different tables in the database
