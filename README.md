# intro to SQL  

## Repo short URL [htmlrepo.sage.codes](https://github.com/sagecodes/learn-to-code-html-css)

## Do these things first!
- Download and install a text editor
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- I also recommend using [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as a web browser
- Create a [codepen](https://codepen.io/) account 

<!--###### Download the files for this class:
1. Go to [https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/l2c-html-css-2018](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/l2c-html-css-2018)
2. Click on the button on the right-hand side that says "Download ZIP"
3. Go to your downloads folder and double click on the .zip file to unzip it
4. IMPORTANT! Leave all the individual files in the downloaded folder (if you would like to move it out of the downloads folder move the entire folder, not individual items)
5. From Atom: File > open, select the folder and then click "Open"
6. From Atom: If the file tree does not appear on the left hand View > Toggle Tree View -- this will show you the entire folder within Atom
7. *Now if you already know some of what we're talking about,* you're all set to poke around in the files -- `index.html` and `CSS/style.css` are the two files we will using.
8. The `examples` folder contains an example of a simple web page using HTML and CSS. If you get stuck you might want to refer to the example page.
